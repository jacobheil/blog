This is also a work in progress. 

The personal blog of Jacob Heil, in which I'll write about digital scholarship (in general), humanities (in particular), pedagogy, and project management. With luck, I'll also write about my disciplinary interests in Early Modern English Literature and the material book, especially in the handpress period. When I'm feeling presumptuous I might write about library things, even though I'm an interloper, and about Liberal Arts Colleges writ large.
