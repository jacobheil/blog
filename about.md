The personal blog of Jacob Heil, in which I'll write about digital scholarship (in general), humanities (in particular), pedagogy, and project management. With luck, I'll also write about my disciplinary interests in Early Modern English Literature and the material book, especially in the handpress period. When I'm feeling presumptuous I might write about library things, even though I'm an interloper, and about Liberal Arts Colleges writ large. When I have time to explore such things, I'll also write about the processes by which I learn -- and learn to teach -- new tools, methods, and ideas. (Like setting up a blog using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).)

When writing, writing about: digital scholarship, humanities, project management, and pedagogy; liberal arts colleges and DH/DS; and possibly my dogs.
