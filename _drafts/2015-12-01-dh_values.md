A guide for mentors who are mentoring DH projects without a net. 

First off, you have a net. It's the rest of your campus. 

In some versions of this mentorship the DH faculty are able to drive both the technologocai and the disciplinary questions. IN LACs (and in places where the mentor is not a DHer) the mentor can drive the humanistic question but should feel comfportable relying on other resources for the technological, digital humanities stuff. 

Don't forget that DH projects should always be about the inquiry first, the humanistic question. This is true of students as well. Don't make a DH project about the DH process. That would be great to learn, yes, but the project should look like a humanities project first, a digital projct second. The latter informs the former, it doesn't supercede it. It's important that the DH project be legible to the community. That's how we advocate for digital humanities: by foregrounding the humanistic questions as such. 

Also, this is just reaching out for collaborators across campus. 

Mentoring might look a little different now. It takes a village. We all say that DH is collaborative, and that doesn't just mean learning how to work across disciplinary boundaries to evaluate multi-authored projects (e.g.), it also means thinking differently about the level of interaction with the student.
