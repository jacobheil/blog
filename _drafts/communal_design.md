I’m grateful for the chance to be on this panel today and -- as always -- I’m learning a great deal. The organizers either know me well or just fortunately sandwiched what seems to me to be a squishy center... 

I’d like to bracket this presentation today as a question
everything is “of the moment” (joke abt bad French, when in Rome, au currant)
Digital Scholar in the Ohio Five
In that capacity we’re building projects but (obviously) trying to figure out how to sustain these efforts going forward. 
So half of what I do is top-level PM, or maybe project coordination or project facilitation is better.
but the other half is thinking about community building. 
I think I want to amplify a strain of conversation about seemingly wiggly concepts in our burgeoning digital cultures: 
I’ll speak today about fostering communities of practice, creating the frameworks out of which projects can grow organically.
And I want eventually to bring this back around a recent post by Bethany Nowviskie that considers “an ethics of Care” and “careful” practices... 
... and its relation to conversations I’ve been privileged to be a part of about “Ethical Collaboration.” 
I should say, though, that my attention to these wiggly concepts -- ethics, community building, care -- is just a sort of meta-reading.
It’s a framework, maybe, for what I hope is useful provocation 
that is: I’ll suggest that LACs are in a particularly good place to model community- and project-development practices, specifically as they relate to digital projects.
AND I recognize the dangers in painting with broad strokes
Don’t want to fetishize the LAC campus or duplicate an “LAC construct” (channelling Kirschenbaum) that suggests LACs do things a certain way (in of course uniquely nuanced ways)
...as I said, this is all kind of of the moment for me so I’ll welcome conversation here or virtually (GESTURE TO the info on the slides about twitter etc.) 


Data/Context
One of my goals for the grant is to produce some guiding documentation on the evaluation of digital scholarship in our consortium. 
Akin to much less comprehensive than MLA/AHA guidelines
something like the Emory Humanities Center memorandum
shaped for LACs (and how does this look different)?
Seeking models from peer institutions, I sent out an informal survey to the Oberlin group library directors (large-ish group to which I had access)
Of my 20 responses (~25 %) no one knew of any existing documentation about evaluation criteria etc 
Only 4 indicated that there were not conversations about this and only 4 additionally indicated that they weren’t really sure
And in those places where conversations ARE happening they're happening all over campus: in departments, in the libraries, in upper administration and (that most crucial of data points) around the water cooler
So I didn’t get what I wanted: model documentation, but these responses suggest that we’re having informal conversations without having formalized any guidelines. 
It may be the case that formal documentation isn’t the goal, I should have asked that.
But I think for my interests here it’s the conversation that matters most, actually. 
It suggest that we have an opportunity, in this moment, to shape the ways in which talk about the (digital work) that we do.
 
Value(s)
Once we’re able to piece together a document on evaluation of scholarship -- call it a set of guidelines, call it a position statement, just don’t call it policy -- then we’ll be moving in the direction of having a shared, consortial way of talking about the issue. A shared framework for evaluating the work and for talking about “value” in the work.
Thanks to a group working at SCI, I learned recently that this could also mean an actual shared vocabulary
(I think you librarians -- and, hopefully, digital humanists linking data -- refer to them as “controlled vocabularies” -- but I want to steer away from the “controlled” and more toward the “open-source” vocabulary.)
A group has recently applied for a grant to explore the utility of the Taxonomy of Digital Research Activities in the Humanities (TaDiRAH) as a way of guiding project development strategies. 
Something like TaDiRAH has potential to help practitioners and collaborators define their work for the purposes of evaluation.
Potentially problematic, of course: dangerous to “value” taxonomies 
Doesn’t have to be prescriptive: We can hack the taxonomies (they’re on Github) and make them local
All of this conversation about value, indeed, is a slippery slope
go forth with care, carefully -- that is, conscious of our communities
And yet, I think, we must go forth, even with an imperfect framework (structure necessitates creativity)
Because amplifying the conversations that we’re having on campus, about evaluation and value, helps to raise the level of discourse on campus or in a community.
Doing this with a shared vocabulary -- a shared sense of what we mean when we talk about digital scholarship -- might helpfully lend a general sense of heft to our practices, rather than a precise measure of their weight. 
I am thinking about this from the standpoint of different communities, and communities within communities, coming to a shared understanding their meanings. 
In this way, perhaps, the value of Digital Scholarship for these communities might also adequately represent the values of that community. 
It’s the Mission, stupid.
At an event organized by Bill Pannapacker on behalf of the Great Lakes Colleges Association, Sarah Purcell on “defining digital liberal arts.” 
our missions are locally-defined but hold at their core the goal to create culturally aware and critically astute undergraduates.
So e.g. critically reading TADIRAH an opp to model the kind of critical reading of our tools that we want to instill in our students.
But in positioning the digital scholarship undertaken on our campuses as not *just* a set of practices but one that is an extension of this mission, we might begin to see how our communities of practice can fold into communal project development, community-informed digital pedagogies, and mission-centered modes of intellectual inquiry.
This gets at the kinds of things that Bill Pannapacker and then Rafael Alvarado are after in “stop calling it digital humanities” and to “start calling it digital liberal arts.” respectively.
The work is already tied into the endeavors and practices that we have come to value and, in some cases, to identify with liberal arts colleges. 
Examples
Denison Student and defining her role as a project manager
We want to value student work appropriately (don’t be evil)
this gives her a way of talking framing her duties 
On the one hand this foregrounds its experiential nature, supplanting its definition as a “research assistantship”
on the other Ethically establishes her position as a research partner. 
So having a way of talking about her work that is comprehensible by a broader constituency empowers both the student and perpetuates a local sense of the community value: that is talking about the work she’s doing is good for her AND good for business. 
A more general way that we are attempting to perpetuate communal project development is in the creation of our project teams. 
Projects are idiosyncratic and so each requires an agreed-upon framework for participants’ roles and expected outcomes
project charters
for us: collaboratively written project proposals
We’re moving in the right direction but can be more deliberate in the way that we frame the goals. 
Teams are assembled as representatives of different viewpoints, not necessarily different sets of skills: Library, Faculty, Ed Tech, Student, Me. 
We’re a community of practitioners and not necessarily pieces of projects. That is to say that solutions to the question at hand -- the reason we’re sitting around the table -- grow out of the affordances  of the group.
We wanted to (I WANTED to) build projects on the scale of the Valley of the Shadow, or Linked Jazz in the Ohio Five, but it is clear that we must meet the projects where they live. 
Going forward, HOWEVER, if we want to build our capacity for different kinds of projects, we’ll do well to foster the growth of individuals WHILE accentuating the importance of the community to our developing practice.  

So this work on building capacity via community, or at least my framing of it here, I think is in conversation with -- engaged with some of the concepts within -- Bethany Nowviskie’s recent talk at on Graduate Education reform, which she published on her blog as a post “On Capacity and Care.” 
“How might taking care—and taking the concept of care more seriously in graduate education and cultural heritage infrastructure-building—serve to expand our scope?”
Careful consideration of projects means having deliberate, shared conversations about our work. That’s how it manifests for the OH5.
In LACs it’s care in that sense derived, as Nowviskie has it, from the feminist foundations: “...a feminist ethic of care has generally been more focused on people than on things. Its major domains have been teaching, parenting, nursing, social work, and librarianship.”
For us in OH5 at least, and I think in liberal arts colleges more generally, we’re about building human “capacity” and not necessarily the capacity for large datasets and reading them. The latter comes as a result of the former. 
SO the ways in which Nowviskie talks about “care” is pertinent to LACs because it’s about building upon an ethos that supports the work
First: it ties into our missions, those thing that drive the work that all of us on the campus.
And, attendant to this, it’s about the communities of practice in which we do this. “Communities” as both the whole campus -- administration, info tech, ed tech, library, students, faculty -- as well as the local setting of the campus, the other citizens for whom and with we work
It’s also worth noting that the we bear the weight of that critique of an ethics of care as well:  it has the capacity to marginalize caring practitioners in ways that (to again borrow Nowviskie’s frame) “perpetuate unjust systems.”
Noting the obvious differences of kind, Nowviskie thinks about this critique in the context of the “service roles” (paraprofessionals, adjuncts) vis a vis empowered faculty. 
I’d add to this -- and it’s certainly explicit elsewhere in Nowviskie piece -- the student’s role. In her context it’s the graduate student and for is it’s the undergraduate. 
Again, though, it’s all like a fortunate confluence of conversations, the harmonies of which I haven’t quite worked through...
I was honored to be a part of a group at the 2015 Scholarly Communication Institute that was working on networked knowledge, and we landed on an exploration of Ethical Collaboration that will be thinking through this wiggly issue. 
Our team was heterogeneously constructed, and it included two undergraduates, and their perspectives -- and our meta-analysis of this kind of participation -- shaped the outcomes for our group. 

AND SO i sense that (more wiggliness, I know) we are in this moment of considered, considerate digital project and project team development. (deploying “consideration” as a tactical term -- channeling Nowviskie). Coincidentally or not, I see that we’re also -- in LACs -- at a moment when we are having conversations about the direction of DS on our campuses, in our communities before policies are being set forth. All of this suggests that we might best be served by being deliberate and preemptive in the ways that shape these conversations by working together as communities, communally.
