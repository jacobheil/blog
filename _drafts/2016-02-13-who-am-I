## Who am I and what am I doing here? 

This is a post about the work that I do, what I call my work, and the kinds of things that I think about. It's an introducttory post, but it's more than that, right? It should also have something to say about #altac work, about Miriam's post on the "make DH happen" postdoc. It doesn't have so much about my trajectory -- that stuff is on the about me page, yeah? -- but something of a philosophy of the challenges I set for myself. 

Maybe there is something about imposter syndrome in here.
