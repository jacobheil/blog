### Toward a Taxonomy of Collaboration

After a couple of years of team-assembling and project-building under the auspices of the Ohio Five's [Digital Scholarship initiative](http://digitalscholarship.ohio5.org/), we have seen a variety of kinds of collaboration, each of which requiring different technological infrastrcutures and campus partnerships. I propose a "long presentation" (20 minutes) in which I work through a developing taxonomy of these collaborations -- including (e.g.), at present, "infectious" and "coincidental" collaborations -- and the utility (or not?) of such distinctions. For me, it is not so much the taxonomic structure, as such, that is important, but rather that such a structure may allow an entity such as a consortium, or an individual campus, or even an entity on campus (i.e. the library) to identify by comparison the kind of digital community to which it belongs. This is to suggest a handful of observations that I will offer as provocations: that there is a link between the kinds of digital project that will grow out of a particular digital culture and the kind(s) of collaboration with which one identifies, that the former is in fact limited by the latter, and that understanding these limits -- and how to push against them -- gets us closer to thinking about a digital scholarship for which "the project" is not the basic unit but "the collaborative community."

This is at the level of superstrcuture: what is the 

Important to building up the culture of digital schoalrship.
