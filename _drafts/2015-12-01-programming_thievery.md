In the 3 DEC course for Programming for Humanists Stefan Sinclair made a point of discussing originality in programming... in programming, one doesn't want to reinvent the wheel... one wants to find what someone else has done with the kinds of things you want to do and then hack that code. 

The purpose of this post is to say that this reminds me of something we had in Central Virginia Writing Project about "hacking" lesson plans. "Thievery is homage" is what we said. This isn't the same thing as what Stefan is saying, per se, because it's about doing LESS work. But it might be a useful way of helping humanists think about "plagiarism." I think that this is something that I have a hard time and I think that it's behind my implulse to *learn all the things*.
