### Care-ful DH

I'm thinking about a post that maybe includes the premise of my talk at DLF last year on building capacity AND that builds on it by talking about the slow nature of my process. I might blog about the process itself over at the OH5 site -- or at least the process of posting those blogs -- and then do the kind of meta conversation over here on this site. 

The long and short is that there's somethig t0o be said for a slower, more deliberate way of practicing DH. There's something about repetitive, iterative moves (in command line, wiht GIT, using Jeckyll) that helps one to learn somehting. This is in contrast, perhaps, to the push for technological or tech-basd efficiency and speed. My processes are not the most efficient. My processes in fact shirk the intention behind the WYSIWYG; my priocess gets me closer to the processes a little. It's not for everyone, but for someone who needs *some* sort of facility at the command line -- who needs to know how these kinds of things work -- who needs to be abelt o speak authoritatively about (say) Github and git -- it's a place in my workflow that allows for a sneaky kind of training. Stealth practice sessions. 

So Slow DH is about taking care to be thoughtful in your work. This includes, I think, being attentive to one's own needs. I know that I won't have as much time to push code (as such) to github, but that doesn't mean that I can't find time to practice.
